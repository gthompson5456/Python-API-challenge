The highest temperature was actually found at latitude 20,  which is ironic considering most of the times, people would assume it should be at latitude 0 (on the equator). However, the temperatures, in general, still get lower as you get further away from the equator on both sides.
Latitude did not have much effect on wind speed. Ignoring the outliers, wind speed was evenly spread out through almost all latitudes.
The humidity in the southern hemisphere climates were much less intense and less apparent compared to the northern hemisphere climates. This could be due to the fact that there is more land, and therefore more people and pollution, in the northern hemisphere.
